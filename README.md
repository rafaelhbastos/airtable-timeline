- What you like about your implementation?
  It looks like is going somewhere, however I couldn't finish it. The rush made me do some things I didn't want to, but the sctructure with more time would be good for using hooks and components.

- What you would change if you were going to do it again?
  I would try to plan it better, since I've never done something like this before, specially working with dates. My biggest problem was to put JS and CSS in sync for rendering things correclty on the screen and time was off.

- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that?
  I didn't put any designs, I was trying to make things work first, but I would use the one provided from dropbox

- How you would test this if you had more time?
  Insert some event data and get if the position is correct on the screen based on the date, year, month, day etc.
